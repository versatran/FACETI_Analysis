% Attempts to remove X-rays that hit the CCD from the image A.
% If the optional argument 'plot' is given, a diagnostic plot is generated
% in the current figure.
%
% Algorithm: compare every pixel to the average of a surrounding ring. If
% it exceeds this by a certain threshold, it is considered to be an X-ray.
% In that case, the region is expanded by one pixel in every direction and
% the values are replaced by a smooth function that is determined by
% imposing Laplace f = 0.
%
% This version is optimized for the Princeton 16-bit camera that was used to
% measure the downstream energy spectrum in E-167.
% This camera often shows X-rays that extend over more than one pixel.

Asmooth = conv2(A, ring, 'same');

% this was the first algorithm, but it was not very successful
%B = A;
%B(XR) = Asmooth(XR);

%% find X-rays
% now, the difficult part is to find the X-rays.

% the following criteria have to be met by this algorithm:
% - the density of X-rays is constant across the regions where ther is beam
%   and outside of the beam
% - no part of the beam is removed
% - no X-rays are detected from the noise in the background
% - the end result is somewhat independent of the exact values of arbitrarily
%   chosen numbers

% the noise in the background is about 2 ADC counts; for the noise in the
% number of photons, assume something proportional to the number of ADC
% counts
%sigma_bg = 2;
%threshold = 5*sigma_bg + 5*sqrt(abs(Asmooth));
%XR = A > Asmooth + threshold;

% Another way is to find points with a negative Laplacian (more precisely,
% where the relative value of the Laplacian is smaller than a certain threshold
%L = del2(A);
%XR = -L./A > 0.1;

% I have found that a combined relative-absolute criterion with arbitrarily 
% choosen offset and threshold works better than the previous idea
XR = (A+offset)./(Asmooth+offset) > threshold;

% I have observed that the X-rays are sometimes a bit larger than what was
% detected using this method. Therefore, I expand the X-Rays by 1 pixel in 
% all directions:

SE = strel('square',3);
XR2 = imdilate(XR,SE);

%% eliminate the X-rays
% replace every X-ray by a smooth function.
% This is achieved by finding a function that satisfies 
%     Laplace f = 0
% inside the eliminated region and is equal to the image outside those 
% regions.
% (Ben knows how to do this. Luckily, there is an Image Processing Toolbox
% function that does exactly what we want)

B = roifill(A,XR2);

% %% remove the padded border
% B = B(1+padsize:end-padsize, 1+padsize:end-padsize);
